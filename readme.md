# ProtoCol

ProtoCol is an application originally designed to run on a Raspberry Pi to control a Protogen head via a wrist-mounted touchscreen. 



## Credits:

ProtoCol was inspired by the early stages of a private repository, which was originally written by a collaborator who currently wishes to remain anonymous. I contributed to that project very early on in development and during the process of refactoring, decided to split my code into a separate project rather than effectively rewrite their entire work. This also allows me to eventually make ProtoCol public, without any risk of de-anonymizing my collaborators through commit history or crediting.

All code on initial commit is my own work, except where credited otherwise. The "ProtoCol" name is also my own idea, inspired by the name of the original private repository.
